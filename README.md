# MealmarJobs

MealmarJobs is a recruitment platform originally built with Java and Spring. This version has been rewritten using React and Node.js. You can view the original Java and Spring implementation on my [GitHub here](https://github.com/MarcinPasynczuk/RecruitmentPlatformJavaSpringBoot).

Through this project, I explored the capabilities of React and Node.js and learned how to adapt code from one technology stack to another.
